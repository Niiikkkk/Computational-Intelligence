    "\n",
    "This class represents a player who uses the MinMax algorithm to make decisions in the game. The MinMax algorithm is a search algorithm that is used in two-player games to make optimal decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "- ``playerPlaying`` (int): The player who is currently playing.\n",
    "- ``levels_depth`` (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the depth level and the maximum number of possible moves for that depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "- ``game_evaluation``: Evaluate the game state based on the current player and depth. If player X wins, the reward is 1, otherwise it is -1. If player O plays instead, the rewards are reversed.\n",
    "- ``min_max``: Perform the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the current player. This method takes as input the current game, the alpha and beta values (used for alpha-beta pruning, a technique for reducing the number of nodes evaluated by the MinMax algorithm), and the current depth of the search tree. If the depth is zero or if there is a winner in the game, the method returns the game rating and no moves. Otherwise, for each possible move, it creates a copy of the game, makes the move, and recursively calls the min_max method on the copy of the game. If the returned rating is greater than alpha, alpha is updated and the move is considered the best move. If beta is less than or equal to alpha, the cycle stops for alpha-beta pruning.\n",
    "The process is similar for the case where the current player is non-zero, with the difference that we try to minimize the rating instead of maximizing it.\n",
    "- ``choose_action``: Choose the best action (move) for the current player using the Minimax algorithm. The method starts by getting all possible moves for the current player using the `get_possible_moves` function. It then calculates the search depth for the MinMax algorithm based on the number of possible moves. This is done through a for loop that passes through the `levels_Depth` list. If the number of possible moves is greater than a certain value, the depth is set to a certain level. The cycle stops as soon as a level is found that does not exceed the number of possible moves. The method then calls the `min_max` method to determine the best move for the current player. Finally, the method returns the best move."
