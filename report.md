# Lab 1 -- Set Covering

```python
import numpy as np
from random import random
from functools import reduce
from queue import PriorityQueue
```




### What is set covering
The goal of set covering is to find all the sets that covers all the values. We have `NUM_SETS` that is the number of sets and `PROBLEM_SIZE` that is the lenght of the values of each set. The value is choosen between `True` and `False`.


```python
PROBLEM_SIZE = 8
NUM_SETS = 10
```


```python
sets = [np.array([random() < .3 for _ in range(PROBLEM_SIZE)]) for _ in range(NUM_SETS)]
assert np.all(reduce(np.logical_or,[sets[i] for i in range(NUM_SETS)])), "Not solvable"
```

### State
The state , for exampe `state = ({1,3,5}, {0,2,4,6,7})` is composed of 2 parts:
- The first part is the taken sets
- The second part is the not taken sets

The goal is to cover all the sets, but with the minimum number of taken sets


```python
state = ({1,3,5}, {0,2,4,6,7})
#We took 1,3,5 and not taken 0,2,4,6,7, we'll rapresent the states in this way, 2 sets.
```

### Functions
- `goal_check(state)`: returns _True_ only if the first set of the state contains all True, meaning that the sets are all covered.
- `distance(state)`: returns the number of sets that have to be covered.
- `h(state)`: this is the heristic function. 
    - `largest_set_size` is the set with the max number of _True_.
    - `missing_size` is the number of uncovered values to get to the goal (everything covered).
    At the end the heuristic tells us how many sets we need at least to get the job done.
    For example if `larget_set_size` is 4 and `missing_size` is 5 we'll need at least 2 sets for compleating the covering. (we have that the max set is 4, to get to 5 we'll need at least 2 sets)
- `actual_cost(state)`: return the actual cost, that is the lenght of the taken sets.
- `f(n)`: this is the A* function. The goal of A* is to look at the actual cost (the past) but also have an heuristic about the future, given the actual node.


```python
def goal_check(state):
    return np.all(reduce(np.logical_or,[sets[i] for i in state[0]],np.array([False for _ in range(PROBLEM_SIZE)])))
#the reduce does the OR operation on the sets[i] for i in state[0], so the elements taken!!. Then return the AND between the elementes returned
# by the reduce (by the np.all()).

def distance(state):
    return PROBLEM_SIZE - sum(reduce(np.logical_or,[sets[i] for i in state[0]],np.array([False for _ in range(PROBLEM_SIZE)])))
#This function  return the distance of the state from the goal. That's the number of false we still have and
# that has to be covered. The sum returs us the number of true value. 

def covered(state):
    return reduce(
        np.logical_or,
        [sets[i] for i in state[0]],
        np.array([False for _ in range(PROBLEM_SIZE)]),
    )

def h(state):
    largest_set_size = max(sum(s) for s in sets)
    missing_size = PROBLEM_SIZE - sum(covered(state))
    optimistic_estimate = np.ceil(missing_size / largest_set_size)
    return optimistic_estimate

def actual_cost(state):
    return len(state[0]) #The actual cost is the number of elements I have in the first set

def f(n):
    return actual_cost(n) + h(n) #This is the A* function
```

### Code 
We use a `PriorityQueue` where the "key" is the f(n) !! So when we are doing `_,state = frontier.get()` we'll get the state with the lowest `f(state)`


```python
frontier = PriorityQueue()
initial_state = (set(),set(range(NUM_SETS))) #everithing not taken !
frontier.put((f(initial_state),initial_state))

_,state = frontier.get()
counter =0 
while not goal_check(state):
    for a in state[1]: #in state[1] I have all the elements that I didn't take
        counter+=1
        new_state = (state[0] | {a}, state[1] - {a}) #The | is UNION, - is DIFFERENCE
        frontier.put((f(new_state),new_state))
    _,state = frontier.get()
```


```python
print(counter)
state
```

# Lab 2 -- ES

Solution and Notebook made by Riccardo Cardona (https://github.com/Riden15) and Nicholas Berardo (https://github.com/Niiikkkk)

## Task

Write agents able to play [*Nim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), with an arbitrary number of rows and an upper bound $k$ on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn (a.k.a., *subtraction game*).

The goal of the game is to **avoid** taking the last object.

* Task2.1: An agent using fixed rules based on *nim-sum* (i.e., an *expert system*)
* Task2.2: An agent using evolved rules using ES

## Instructions

* Create the directory `lab2` inside the course repo 
* Put a `README.md` and your solution (all the files, code and auxiliary data if needed)

## Notes

* Working in group is not only allowed, but recommended (see: [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy) and [Cooperative Learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1096789.pdf)). Collaborations must be explicitly declared in the `README.md`.
* [Yanking](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KillingAndYanking) from the internet is allowed, but sources must be explicitly declared in the `README.md`.




```python
import logging
from pprint import pprint, pformat
from collections import namedtuple
import random
from copy import deepcopy
```

## The *Nim* and *Nimply* classes


```python
Nimply = namedtuple("Nimply", "row, num_objects")
```

`Nim` is the class of the Nim game. In the *init* function we set the rows, that is an array like [1,3,5,7,...]. The *nimming* method first checks if the move can be done, then if possible subrtact the num_objects to the row specified in the move. The *reset* method is used for training.


```python
class Nim:
    def __init__(self, num_rows: int, k: int = None) -> None:
        self.initial_rows = [i * 2 + 1 for i in range(num_rows)]
        self._rows = self.initial_rows.copy()
        self._k = k

    def __bool__(self):
        return sum(self._rows) > 0

    def __str__(self):
        return "<" + " ".join(str(_) for _ in self._rows) + ">"

    @property
    def rows(self) -> tuple:
        return tuple(self._rows)

    def nimming(self, ply: Nimply) -> None:
        row, num_objects = ply
        assert self._rows[row] >= num_objects
        assert self._k is None or num_objects <= self._k
        self._rows[row] -= num_objects

    def reset(self):
        self._rows = self.initial_rows.copy()
```

## Sample (and silly) startegies 


```python
def pure_random(state: Nim) -> Nimply:
    """A completely random move"""
    #takes a row r if the value of that row c is > 0
    row = random.choice([r for r, c in enumerate(state.rows) if c > 0])
    #take a random value from 1 to the value of the row
    num_objects = random.randint(1, state.rows[row])
    #subtract it
    return Nimply(row, num_objects)

```


```python
def gabriele(state: Nim) -> Nimply:
    """Pick always the maximum possible number of the lowest row"""
    possible_moves = [(r, o) for r, c in enumerate(state.rows) for o in range(1, c + 1)]
    return Nimply(*max(possible_moves, key=lambda m: (-m[0], m[1])))

```


```python
import numpy as np

#nim_sum mi restituisce XOR in binario delle varie righe che ci sono.
#Se ho 1 e 3, quindi 2 righe:
# 1 -> 01
# 3 -> 11
# 1 XOR 3 = 10 -> 2 
def nim_sum(state: Nim) -> int:
    # {c:032b} mi trasforma il valore di state.rows in binario su 32 bit
    tmp = np.array([tuple(int(x) for x in f"{c:032b}") for c in state.rows])
    #Qua Ã¨ come se facessi XOR, la posso fare con una somma
    xor = tmp.sum(axis=0) % 2
    return int("".join(str(_) for _ in xor), base=2)


def analize(raw: Nim) -> dict:
    cooked = dict()
    cooked["possible_moves"] = dict()
    for ply in (Nimply(r, o) for r, c in enumerate(raw.rows) for o in range(1, c + 1)):
        tmp = deepcopy(raw)
        tmp.nimming(ply)
        cooked["possible_moves"][ply] = nim_sum(tmp)
    return cooked


def optimal(state: Nim) -> Nimply:
    analysis = analize(state)
    logging.debug(f"analysis:\n{pformat(analysis)}")
    spicy_moves = [ply for ply, ns in analysis["possible_moves"].items() if ns != 0]
    if not spicy_moves:
        spicy_moves = list(analysis["possible_moves"].keys())
    ply = random.choice(spicy_moves)
    return ply
```

# Adaptive
- ``NimAgent`` is the class that represent an individual. In our problem, the individual is an array of number between 0 and 1 where each number indicates the probability of making a move in the nim row equivalent to the index of the single number in the array.
- ``make_move``: is the function that, given the ``state`` of the game, first create a possible move for each row of the game board and then take the best one using the individual's odds.


```python
class NimAgent:
    def __init__(self, individual):
        self.individual = individual

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return str(self.individual)
    
    def make_move(self, state) -> Nimply:
        #(row,obj)
        moves = [
            (row, min(state.rows[row], max(1, int(self.individual[row] * state.rows[row]))))
            for row in range(len(state.rows)) if state.rows[row] > 0]
        
        # Select the move with the highest preference, the highest preference is the one with the highest genome value. 
        # Self.individual[x[0]] indicates the probability associated with the row of the game board x[0] that we want to modify
        chosen_move = max(moves, key=lambda x: self.individual[x[0]])

        # Return the move
        return Nimply(*chosen_move) #the * is used for unpacking, chosen_move is an array!!! We want only the element inside
```

## Evolutionary algorithm functions

- ``reproduce``: function that creates new individuals with ``mutation`` and ``crossover`` based on the ``mutation_probability``.
- ``mutation``: function that modifies every probability in the individual selected by the ``reproduce`` function. It modifies the values with a Gaussian distribution making sure that the genome is within 0 and 1 after the mutation.
- ``crossover``: It creates a child genome by randomly selecting each gene from either parent with equal probability.
- ``replacement``: This function receives as parameters the population, the new individuals crated by the ``reproduce`` function and the ``fitness_score`` that indicates the times one individual wins against the optimal algorithm. In this function we sort the population based on the ``fitness_score`` and replace the worst individuals. In the end, half of the population will be changed and the other half will be preserved.


```python
def reproduce(selected_agents, mutation_rate):
    new_population = []

    while len(new_population) < len(selected_agents):
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            parent1 = random.sample(selected_agents, 1)[0]
            child_genome = mutation(parent1.individual, mutation_rate)
        else:
            parent1, parent2 = random.sample(selected_agents, 2)
            child_genome = crossover(parent1.individual, parent2.individual)
        new_population.append(NimAgent(child_genome))
    return new_population

def mutation(genome, mutation_rate, mu=0, sigma=1):
    for prob in range(len(genome)):
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutation = random.gauss(mu,sigma)
            genome[prob] = min(max(genome[prob] + mutation, 0), 1) 
    return genome

def crossover(genome1, genome2):
    child_genome = [g1 if random.random() > 0.5 else g2 for g1, g2 in zip(genome1, genome2)]
    return child_genome

def replacement(population, new_population, fitness_scores):
    sorted_population = sorted(zip(population, fitness_scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) 
    survivors = sorted_population[:len(population) - len(new_population)]
    return [agent for agent, score in survivors] + new_population
```

## Populations functions
- ``initialize_population``: this function creates a population of size ``population_size`` composed of elements of type ``NimAgent``. This element is composed of an array named ``individual`` with size ``genome_length``. Each value of the array is a random number between 0 and 1 that represents the probability of making a move in the row equivalent to the index of the element in the array.
- ``evaluate_population``: this function evaluates the population with the number of wins they can achieve against the optimal algorithm. In a game therefore our algorithm will be based on making a move on the line with greater probability written in an ``individual``. We pass as input the ``population`` that is the array of ``NimAgent``, ``nim`` is the status of the game and ``num_games`` represent the number of matches that the population has to do against the optimal algorithm.
- ``select_agents``: this function implements the logic to select the fittest agents and to do that we use a simple tournament selection. it takes 2 random participants from the population and selects the winner based on how many times this individual wins against the optimal algorithm i.e., the ``fitness_score``. We repeat this process until we have half of the ``population_size``.


```python
def initialize_population(pop_size, genome_length):
    population = [NimAgent([random.random() for _ in range(genome_length)]) for _ in range(pop_size)]
    return population

def evaluate_population(population : [NimAgent], nim: Nim, num_games: int):
    wins = []
    for individual in population:
        strategy = (optimal,individual.make_move)
        win = 0
        for _ in range(num_games):
            nim.reset()
            player = 0
            while nim:
                if player == 1:
                    ply = strategy[player](nim)
                else:
                    ply = strategy[player](nim)
                nim.nimming(ply)
                player = 1 - player
            if player == 1:
                win+=1
        wins.append(win)
    return wins

def select_agents(population, fitness_scores):
    selected = []
    while len(selected) < len(population) // 2:
        participant = random.sample(list(zip(population, fitness_scores)), 2)
        winner = max(participant, key=lambda x: x[1])
        selected.append(winner[0])
    return selected
```

## Evolution Strategy

Problem parameters:
- ``nim``: Object of type Nim with the status of the game
- ``generations``: number of generations of population to create
- ``population_size``: size of the population
- ``initial_mutation_rate``: probability to do mutation
- ``wins_goal``: number of victories to be achieved to finish the creation of new generations first
- ``num_games``: number of games against the optimal algorithm to adjust the fitness scores
- ``mutation_probability``: probability to do mutation instead of crossover

In the ``evolutionary_strategy`` function, we implement the logic of the Evolutionary Algorithm. It returns the population with the best individual found.


```python
GENERATIONS = 50
POPULATION_SIZE = 10
WINS_GOAL = 90
NUM_GAMES = 100
MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.3
```


```python
def evolutionary_strategy(nim, generations, population_size, wins_goal, num_games, mutation_probability):
    population = initialize_population(population_size, len(nim.rows))
    best_individual = None
    best_fitness = -1

    for generation in range(generations):
        fitness_scores = evaluate_population(population, nim, num_games)

        # The best score is halved to report the number of wins, since each win is worth double points in the scoring system.
        print(f"Generation {generation}: Best score {max(fitness_scores)} wins")

        # Check for termination condition (e.g., a perfect score)
        if max(fitness_scores) >= wins_goal:
            print("Stopping early, reached perfect score!")
            break

        # Selection
        selected_agents = select_agents(population, fitness_scores)

        # Reproduction
        new_population = reproduce(selected_agents, mutation_probability)

        # Replacement
        population = replacement(population, new_population, fitness_scores)
        
        # Check if the new best individual is found
        max_fitness = max(fitness_scores)
        if max_fitness > best_fitness:
            best_fitness = max_fitness
            best_individual_index = fitness_scores.index(max_fitness)
            best_individual = population[best_individual_index]

    return population, best_individual
```

# LAB9 -- ES

Solution and Notebook made by Riccardo Cardona (https://github.com/Riden15) and Nicholas Berardo (https://github.com/Niiikkkk)

Write a local-search algorithm (eg. an EA) able to solve the *Problem* instances 1, 2, 5, and 10 on a 1000-loci genomes, using a minimum number of fitness calls. That's all.

### Deadlines:

* Submission: Sunday, December 3 ([CET](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cet))
* Reviews: Sunday, December 10 ([CET](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cet))

Notes:

* Reviews will be assigned  on Monday, December 4
* You need to commit in order to be selected as a reviewer (ie. better to commit an empty work than not to commit)


```python
from random import choices,randint

import lab9_lib
```

# Problem
First of all the lab9_lib should be considered as a black box. The goal is to obtain a good fitness value without even knowing what problem is.
Below we can see the fitness of random 50 bit.


```python
fitness = lab9_lib.make_problem(10)
for n in range(10):
    ind = choices([0, 1], k=50)
    print(f"{''.join(str(g) for g in ind)}: {fitness(ind):.2%}")

print(fitness.calls)

# EA
The genome here is a tuple composed of (loci,fitness value). 



### Methods
- `mutation()` flips a random bit from the genome
- `one_cut_xover()` does the one cut crossover (select a point, then take everything from the start to that point from parent1, from the point to the end from parent2)
- `xover` does the crossover for each bit in the genome from parent1 and parent2


```python
import random

def mutation(genome):
    index = randint(0,len(genome[0])-1)
    genome[0][index] = 1-genome[0][index]
    return genome[0]

def one_cut_xover(ind1, ind2):
    cut_point = randint(0, len(ind1[0]))
    offspring = ind1[0][:cut_point]+ind2[0][cut_point:]
    return offspring

def xover(genome1, genome2):
    child_genome = [g1 if random.random() > 0.5 else g2 for g1, g2 in zip(genome1[0], genome2[0])]
    return child_genome
```

- `select_parent` take one individual as champion. *best_parents* is composed of the first population/2 best individual(the ones with high fitness). From this extract 1/10 and pick the champion from this pool.
- `init_population` init the population with *n_individual*. The single individual is a tuple (genome,fitness), where genome is the random loci and fitness is the fitness of the genome


```python
from random import choice

def select_parent(population,fitness):
    best_parents = sorted(population,key= lambda i:i[1],reverse=True)[:int(len(population)/2)]
    pool = [choice(best_parents) for _ in range(int(len(best_parents)/10))]
    champion = max(pool, key=lambda i: i[1])
    return champion

def init_population(n_individual,length,fitness):
    pop = []
    for _ in range(n_individual):
        ind = (choices([0, 1], k=length))
        pop.append((ind,fitness(ind)))
    return pop
```

- `gen_new_population` generates the new population. We have a *mutation_prob* to do the mutation, otherwise we do the xover. Both uses the *select_parent* function to select the individual to mutate or to apply xover
- `replacement` combines the new population and the old population, then select the best ones based on the fitness. 


```python
def gen_new_population(n_new_indivdual,mutation_prob,old_population,fitness):
    new_individual = []
    for _ in range(n_new_indivdual):
        if random.random() < mutation_prob:
            old_ind = select_parent(old_population,fitness)
            tmp = mutation(old_ind)
        else:
            old_ind = select_parent(old_population,fitness)
            old_ind_2 = select_parent(old_population,fitness)
            tmp = xover(old_ind,old_ind_2)
        new_individual.append((tmp,fitness(tmp)))
    return new_individual

def replacement(new_pop,old_pop,fitness):
    tmp_pop = new_pop + old_pop
    sorted_pop = sorted(tmp_pop,key= lambda i:i[1],reverse=True)
    return sorted_pop[:len(new_pop)]
```

### Train
We train for 1,2,5,10 problem size and report the results. 
- We have 100 genome in the population
- The genomes has 1000 lenght
- We train for 300 generation for each problem size


```python
N_INDV = 100
LENGTH_INDV = 1000
GENERATION = 300

problem_size = [1,2,5,10]

for ps in problem_size:
    fit = lab9_lib.make_problem(ps)
    pop = init_population(N_INDV,LENGTH_INDV,fit)
    best = 0
    n_calls = 0
    gen = 0
    for g in range(GENERATION):
        #if g%10 == 0:
        #    avg_fit = sum(list(map(lambda i:i[1],pop)))/len(pop)
        #    print(pop[0][1], avg_fit)
        new_pop = gen_new_population(N_INDV,0.1,pop,fit)
        pop = replacement(new_pop,pop,fit)
        if pop[0][1] > best:
            best = pop[0][1]
            n_calls = fit.calls
            gen = g
    print(f"Problem size: {ps}")
    print(f"Best fitness: {best}")
    print(f"Fitness calls: {n_calls}")
    print(f"Generation: {gen}")
    print(f"Population size: {N_INDV}")

## State of the board

The board is composed of 1 if p1 is playing, -1 if p2 is playing or 0 if the cell is empty.
The winner gets a reward of 1, meanwhile the loser gets a rewoard of 0. If there's a tie, we give the RL player (the p1) a reward of 0.1 because we don't want ties!

### Methods
- `__init__` defines the board and sets the player
- `available_positions` returns the available positions, the positions in which no one played
- `make_move` takes a position as input, check if it's valid and if it is the current_player makes the move in that position 
- `get_hash` return the "hash" of the table, beacuse than we have to save it, and we can't save a np array
- `check_winner` checks if the game has ended and who's the winner in all possible directions
- `reward` give the reward to the winner/loser
- `reset` resets the game, this is needed for the training
- `show_board` prints the board in a pretty way
- `train` make p1 play against p2 for many rounds, than at every move check if someone won, gives the reward and reset the game for another round. Here we also add the state to the players, so they can save it and use it with RL
- `test` makes p1 play againt p2 for one round, check the winner at every move and returns the winner, without setting any state or giving any reward


```python

# RLPlayer

The RL player if composed of an array of states and a dictionary of state_values. 
The action is choosen as follow:
- 30% of the time a random action is choosen
- 70% of the time we pick the action with the highest value

The give_rew() function iterates over the array of states and applies the following formula: 
- V(t) = V(t) + lr * (gamma*V(t+1) - V(t))

### Methods
- `init` sets the RL player, the array of states and the state_values dict, and some parameters used in the following
- `getHash` returns the hash of the table (we can't save the table as a np array, it's better to save it as a string and use it as a key in the states_value dictionary)
- `addState` add the state to the states array (this is called by the training function above)
- `chooseAction` this function return the action to perform in the board. It receives the available_positions, the current_board and the symbol (the player making the move). With a probability of 0.3 (*exp_rate*) does exploration, so picks a random move. For the rest 70% picks the best move among the available. The best move is the one with the highest value in the states_value dictionary.
- `reset` reallocate the array of states
- `give_rew` loops trought the reverse state array and update the values in the dictionary with the formula:
    - V(t) = V(t) + lr * (gamma*V(t+1) - V(t))


```python
class RLPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name, exp_rate = 0.3):
        self.name = name
        self.states = []  # record all positions taken
        self.lr = 0.2
        self.exp_rate = exp_rate
        self.decay_gamma = 0.9
        self.states_value = {}  # state -> value

    def getHash(self, board):
        boardHash = str(board.reshape(3*3))
        return boardHash

    def addState(self, state):
        self.states.append(state)

    def chooseAction(self, positions, current_board, symbol):
        """Return a random action (P = 0.3) or the action with max value (P = 0.7)"""
        if np.random.uniform(0, 1) <= self.exp_rate: # Do exploration, take random 
            # take random action
            idx = np.random.choice(len(positions))
            action = positions[idx]
        else: #Here do exploitation, take the action that has highest value
            value_max = -999
            for p in positions:
                next_board = current_board.copy() #create a tmp board
                next_board[p] = symbol #do the action
                next_boardHash = self.getHash(next_board) #get the hash
                value = 0 if self.states_value.get(next_boardHash) is None else self.states_value.get(next_boardHash)
                # print("value", value)
                if value >= value_max: #find the action that has max value. 
                    value_max = value
                    action = p
        return action
    
    def reset(self):
        self.states = []

    def give_rew(self, reward):
        #At the end of the game i'll get a reward. The iterate on the states in reverse.
        #Â set the value of the state to 0 if not existing, otherwise update it with the reward. 
        for st in reversed(self.states):
            if self.states_value.get(st) is None: #if the state doesn't have a value, set it to 0
                self.states_value[st] = 0
            #this is V(t) = V(t) + lr * (gamma*V(t+1) - V(t))
            self.states_value[st] += self.lr * (self.decay_gamma * reward - self.states_value[st])
            reward = self.states_value[st]
    
```

## Human player

Here we have a human player, so we have an input


```python
class HumanPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name 
    
    def chooseAction(self, positions,current_board, symbol):
        while True:
            row = int(input("Input your action row:"))
            col = int(input("Input your action col:"))
            action = (row, col)
            if action in positions:
                return action
    
    # append a hash state
    def addState(self, state):
        pass
    
    # at the end of game, backpropagate and update states value
    def give_rew(self, reward):
        pass
            
    def reset(self):
        pass
```

## Random player
Here we perform actions randomly, taken from the set of possible actions (positions)


```python
class RandomPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = "random"

    def chooseAction(self, positions,current_board, symbol):
        x = np.random.randint(0,len(positions)-1)
        return positions[x]
    
    def addState(self,state):
        pass

    def give_rew(self, reward):
        pass
            
    def reset(self):
        pass

    def give_rew(self,rew):
        pass
```

## Training
Here we train using 2 RL player, than test it with a random player


```python
p1 = RLPlayer("computer")
p2 = RLPlayer("computer")

st = State(p1,p2)
st.train(100000)
```

st = State(p1,p2)
win_comp = 0

for epoch in range(epochs):
    win = st.test()
    if win == 1:
        win_comp+=1 
    st.reset()

perc = win_comp / epochs * 100

## State
The state is exactly the same as the RL, we don't have the `give_reward` function


```python
class State:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = np.zeros((3,3))
        self.isEnd = False
        self.current_player = 1 #1 is p1, -1 is p2

    def available_moves(self):
        pos = []
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if self.board[i,j] == 0:
                    pos.append((i,j))
        return pos
    
    def make_move(self, position):
        if position not in self.available_moves():
            return None
        self.board[position] = self.current_player
        self.current_player = self.current_player*-1

    def getHash(self):

    def reset(self):
        self.board = np.zeros((3, 3))
        self.boardHash = None
        self.isEnd = False
        self.playerSymbol = 1

    def showBoard(self):

## QL player
The reward() return 1 if the player won, -1 if the player lost and 0 if no one won, or the game is still going
### Methods
- `init` initialize the dictionary Q and sets some parameters. The Q table is a dict that has as key the tuple (board,action)
- `chooseAction` again for 30% of the time perform exploration doing a random move, otherwise take the values from the Q table for that board and all the possilbe action that can be done from that state. Then take the action with the highest value
- `addState` add the state and action to the states list
- `reset` resets the states list
- `update_Q` updates the Q table in a similar way done with RL.
    - Q(t) = Q(t) + alpha * (df * Q(t+1) - Q(t))


```python
class QL:
    def __init__(self,name,alpha,eps,disc_factor):
        self.Q = defaultdict(lambda: 0.0)
        self.name = name
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.eps = eps
        self.disc_factor = disc_factor
        self.states = []

    def chooseAction(self,board,moves):
        if random.random() < self.eps:
            return random.choice(moves)
        else:
            values = [self.Q[(board,a)] for a in moves]
            max_value = np.max(values)
            if values.count(max_value) > 1: #if there're more than one actions that has max value take random
                best_move = [i for i in range(len(values)) if values[i] == max_value]
                i = random.choice(best_move)
            else:
                i = values.index(max_value)
            return moves[i]
    
    def addState(self,state,move):
        self.states.append((state,move))

    def reset(self):
        self.states=[]

    def update_Q(self,reward):
        for st in reversed(self.states):
            current_q_value = self.Q[(st[0], st[1])] # st[0] = board state st[1] = action
            reward = current_q_value + self.alpha * (self.disc_factor * reward - current_q_value)
            self.Q[(st[0], st[1])] = reward
    
```

## Random player
Performs random moves


```python
class RandomPlayer:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = "random"

    def chooseAction(self, game,positions):
        return random.choice(positions)
    
    def addState(self,state):
        pass
            
    def reset(self):
        pass

    def reward(self,rew):
        pass

    def update_Q(self,rew):
        pass
```

## Train and Test QL Player
The train code is very similar to the RL train, changes just the update_Q instead of give_rew.
Also the test is very similar. 


```python
def train(game:State, p1: QL, p2: RandomPlayer,epochs = 20000):
    for epoch in tqdm(range(epochs)):
        game.reset()
        p1.reset()
        p2.reset()
        while game.check_winner() is None:
            #Player 1
            possilbe_moves = game.available_moves()
            move = p1.chooseAction(game.getHash(),possilbe_moves)
            p1.addState(game.getHash(),move)
            game.make_move(move)
            if game.check_winner() is not None:
                if game.check_winner() == 1:
                    p1.update_Q(1) #player 1 won, so give 1 reward
                    p2.update_Q(0)
                elif game.check_winner() == -1:
                    p1.update_Q(0)
                    p2.update_Q(1)
                else:
                    p1.update_Q(0.1) #give a less reward because we don't want ties
                    p2.update_Q(0.5)
            else:
                #Player 2
                possilbe_moves = game.available_moves()
                move = p2.chooseAction(game.getHash(),possilbe_moves)
                game.make_move(move)
                if game.check_winner() is not None:
                    if game.check_winner() == 1:
                        p1.update_Q(1) #player 1 won, so give 1 reward
                        p2.update_Q(0)
                    elif game.check_winner() == -1:
                        p1.update_Q(0)
                        p2.update_Q(1)
                    else:
                        p1.update_Q(0.1) #give a less reward because we don't want ties
                        p2.update_Q(0.5)

def test(game, p1, p2):
    while game.check_winner() is None:
        #Player 1
        possilbe_moves = game.available_moves()
        move = p1.chooseAction(game.getHash(),possilbe_moves)
        game.make_move(move)

            break
        #Player 2
        possilbe_moves = game.available_moves()
        move = p2.chooseAction(game.getHash(),possilbe_moves)
        game.make_move(move)
    return game.check_winner()
```


```python
p1 = QL("QL",0.2,0.2,0.9)
p2 = RandomPlayer("Random")
game = State()

train(game,p1,p2,200000)

## 8 - Puzzle

Here's the code for the 8-puzzle game. I wrote the code at the very beginning of the course, then didn't have time to look at it anymore, maybe with another implementation like EA it could work better. Anyway, the code has a error that I can't understand. 

```python
import numpy as np
from queue import PriorityQueue, LifoQueue, SimpleQueue
```


```python
def print_state(state):
    for j in range(3):
        for i in range(3):
            print(f"{state[i+3*j]}",end=" ")
        print("\n")
```


```python
def goal_check(state):
    return np.all(state == np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-1]))

def distance_check(state):
    return 9-np.sum(state == np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-1]))
```

## State
The state is a tuple composed of the actual state of the board and the numbers that can move (that are near the hole).


```python
queue = PriorityQueue() #the priority is the distance from the goal
initial_state = (np.array([2,5,7,1,0,8,9,3,4]),np.array([5,1,8,3]))
queue.put((distance_check(initial_state[0]),initial_state))

_,state = queue.get()
current_state,state_to_move = state
while not goal_check(current_state):
    idx_hole = np.where(current_state==0)[0].item() #finds the index of the hole
    for i in state_to_move: #for each number that can be moved
        idx_to_change = np.where(current_state==i)[0].item() #finds the index of the number i 
        tmp = current_state.copy()
        tmp[idx_hole] = i
        tmp[idx_to_change] = 0
        tmp_move = [] #now create the set of item that can be moved in the new state
        if idx_to_change-3>=0:
            tmp_move.append(tmp[idx_to_change-3])
            
        if idx_to_change+3<3*3:
            tmp_move.append(tmp[idx_to_change+3])
        
        if idx_to_change > 0 and idx_to_change>3*np.floor((idx_to_change)/3):
            tmp_move.append(tmp[idx_to_change-1])

        if idx_to_change<8 and idx_to_change+1<3+3*np.floor((idx_to_change)/3):
            tmp_move.append(tmp[idx_to_change+1])

        new_state = (np.array(tmp),np.array(tmp_move))
        print(distance_check(new_state[0]))
        
        queue.put((distance_check(new_state[0]),new_state)) #put the new state in the queue
        
    _,state = queue.get()
    current_state,state_to_move = state        
```

## Halloween

```python
from itertools import product
from random import random, randint, shuffle, seed, choice
import numpy as np
from functools import reduce
from scipy import sparse
```


```python
def make_set_covering_problem(num_points, num_sets, density):
    """Returns a sparse array where rows are sets and columns are the covered items"""
    #seed(num_points*2654435761+num_sets+density)
    sets = sparse.lil_array((num_sets, num_points), dtype=bool)
    for s, p in product(range(num_sets), range(num_points)):
        if random() < density:
            sets[s, p] = True
    for p in range(num_points):
        sets[randint(0, num_sets-1), p] = True
    return sets
```

# Halloween Challenge

Find the best solution with the fewest calls to the fitness functions for:

* `num_points = [100, 1_000, 5_000]`
* `num_sets = num_points`
* `density = [.3, .7]` 


```python
num_points = 100
num_sets = num_points
density = .3
x = make_set_covering_problem(num_points, num_sets, density)
```

## Example
initial state = [True, True, False, False, False, True, False, True, True, False]
x = with array([list([1, 2, 5, 9]), list([2, 7]), list([1, 3, 6, 8, 9]),
       list([0, 7, 8]), list([3, 5, 6, 8]), list([2, 9]),
       list([2, 3, 4, 8]), list([1, 2, 8, 9]), list([0, 6, 7, 9]),
       list([0, 2, 4, 6, 7])], dtype=object)
means we take the first ,the second, 6,8,9 sets


```python
initiale_state = [choice([True, False]) for _ in range(num_sets)]
```


```python
def goal_check(state):
    cost = sum(state)
    is_valid = set(np.concatenate(x.rows[state])) == set(i for i in range(num_points))
    return is_valid,-cost
```

## Hill Climbing
The tweak function here flips the 30% of the bits in the state.

Then apply the hill climbing algorithm, that tweaks the state and checks if the new state is better. The problem here is that I could remain stuck in a local optima.


```python
def tweak(state):
    new_state = state.copy()
    for i in range(int(30*num_points/100)): 
        index = randint(0, num_points - 1)
        new_state[index] = not new_state[index]
    return new_state
```


```python
state = initiale_state
for step in range(100):
    new_state = tweak(state)
    if goal_check(state)<goal_check(new_state):
        state=new_state

#print(f"The final state is: {state}")
#print(f"The sets are: {x.rows[state]}")
valid,cost = goal_check(state)
print(f"The solution is: {valid}. I reached the solution with {-cost} sets, so I have a cost of {cost}")
print(f"Those are the covered sets: {set(np.concatenate(x.rows[state]))}")
```

    The solution is: True. I reached the solution with 27 sets, so I have a cost of -27
    Those are the covered sets: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99}


## Simulated Annealing

The tweak is again the same as before, but the algorithm is different. Here we are doing a hill climbing but with a probability of accepting a worse solution with a probability $$ p = e^{-{f(s)-f(s')\over t}} $$ where s is the current state, s' is the new state and t is the temperature. The temperature t is schedule to decrese. When t=0 I won't accept any bad solutions. When t is highet I'll move also to bad solutions, this will add exploration. 


```python
def tweak(state):
    new_state = state.copy()
    for i in range(int(30*num_points/100)): #change 30% of the points
        index = randint(0, num_points - 1)
        new_state[index] = not new_state[index]
    return new_state
```


```python
state = initiale_state
t=num_points
for step in range(num_points):
    new_state = tweak(state)
    oldStateCost = goal_check(state)
    newStateCost = goal_check(new_state)
    p=np.exp(-((oldStateCost[1]-newStateCost[1])/t)) #generate the probability
    t=t-1
    if oldStateCost>=newStateCost and random() < p : #accept a worse solution with a prob p!!
        state=new_state
    else:
        if oldStateCost<newStateCost:
            state=new_state

#print(f"The final state is: {state}")
#print(f"The sets are: {x.rows[state]}")
valid,cost = goal_check(state)
print(f"The solution is: {valid}. I reached the solution with {-cost} sets, so I have a cost of {cost}")
print(f"Those are the covered sets: {set(np.concatenate(x.rows[state]))}")
```

    The solution is: True. I reached the solution with 46 sets, so I have a cost of -46
    Those are the covered sets: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99}


## Tabu search
Again the tweak is the same. The idea is to keep track of the states, so we can avoid to visit them again.


```python
def tweak(state):
    new_state = state.copy()
    for i in range(int(30*num_points/100)): #change 30% of the points
        index = randint(0, num_points - 1)
        new_state[index] = not new_state[index]
    return new_state

def is_valid(state):
    v,c = goal_check(state)
    return v
```


```python
state = initiale_state
tabu_list = []
for step in range(num_points):
    new_sol_list = [tweak(state) for _ in range(int(5*num_points/100))] #generate a list of new solutions
    candidates = [sol for sol in new_sol_list if is_valid(sol) and sol not in tabu_list] #if the solution is valid and not in the tabu_list 
    if not candidates: #if no candidates, keep going
        continue
    for sol in candidates:          #take the best option from the generated ones
        tabu_list.append(sol)
        if goal_check(sol)>goal_check(state):
            state = sol

#print(f"The final state is: {state}")
#print(f"The sets are: {x.rows[state]}")
valid,cost = goal_check(state)
print(f"The solution is: {valid}. I reached the solution with {-cost} sets, so I have a cost of {cost}")
print(f"Those are the covered sets: {set(np.concatenate(x.rows[state]))}")
```

    The solution is: True. I reached the solution with 23 sets, so I have a cost of -23
    Those are the covered sets: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99}


## Iterated Local Search
The tweak is again the same as before. This is Hill Climbing but at the end we restart it.  


```python
def tweak(state):
    new_state = state.copy()
    for i in range(int(30*num_points/100)): #change 30% of the points
        index = randint(0, num_points - 1)
        new_state[index] = not new_state[index]
    return new_state
```


```python
def hill_climbing(initiale_state):
    state = initiale_state
    for step in range(num_points):
        new_state = tweak(state)
        if goal_check(state)<goal_check(new_state):
            state=new_state
    return state
```


```python
N_Restart = 10
state = initiale_state
for i in range(N_Restart):
    solution = hill_climbing(state)
    state = solution

valid,cost = goal_check(state)
print(f"The solution is: {valid}. I reached the solution with {-cost} sets, so I have a cost of {cost}")
print(f"Those are the covered sets: {set(np.concatenate(x.rows[state]))}")
```

    The solution is: True. I reached the solution with 22 sets, so I have a cost of -22
    Those are the covered sets: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99}

## Reinforcement Learning Player
---

This class represents a player that uses Reinforcement Learning to make decisions in Quixo.

Attributes:
- ``epochs`` (int): The number of training epochs.
- ``alpha`` (float): The learning rate.
- ``discount_factor`` (float): The discount factor of the Bellman equation.
- ``min_exploration_rate`` (float): The minimum exploration rate during training.
- ``exploration_decay_rate`` (float): The rate at which the exploration rate decays during training.
- ``opponent`` (Player): The opponent player.
- ``states`` (list): A list to store the states visited during a game.
- ``state_value`` (dict): A dictionary to store the value of each state.
- ``training_phase`` (bool): A boolean to indicate if the player is training or not. It basically enables the exploration if it is true, otherwise it uses only the `state_value` dictionary to make decisions.

Methods:
- ``give_rew(reward)``: Placeholder method for giving reward to the player.
- ``add_state(state)``: Adds to the ``states`` array the state that a player has seen during a game.
- ``reset()``: Reset the ``states`` array to be able to start a new game.
- ``make_move(game)``: Chooses an action to take based on the current game state that can be random or based on the value of the dictionary. It takes from the dictionary, for each possible move, the value associated with the state of the board with the move performed. The maximum value will be the move to execute. We use the following recursive (bellman equation, temporal difference learning) formula to compute the state-value table: 
$$
V(S_t) \leftarrow V(S_t) + \alpha * (\gamma * V(S_t +1) - V(S_t))
$$
The formula simply tells us that the updated value of state t equals the current value of state t adding the difference between the value of next state and the value of current state, which is multiplied by a learning rate Î±.
- ``update_state_value_table(reward)``: Updates the values of the ``states_value`` dictionary based on the states that the player has seen during the game and the reward that they have provided.
- ``game_reward(player)``: Calculates the reward for the player in the current game.
- ``train()``: Trains the player using reinforcement learning.
- ``save_policy(name)``: Saves the state value table to a file.
- ``load_policy(file)``: Loads the state value table from a file.

## MinMax Player
---

This class represents a player who uses the MinMax algorithm to make decisions in the game. The MinMax algorithm is a search algorithm that is used in two-player games to make optimal decisions.

Attributes:
- ``playerPlaying`` (int): The player who is currently playing.
- ``levels_depth`` (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the depth level and the maximum number of possible moves for that depth level.

Methods:
- ``game_evaluation``: Evaluate the game state based on the current player and depth. If the game has ended and the winner is the one that is playing, the reward is 100 + the actual depth, otherwhise is -100 - the actual depth.
- ``min_max``: Perform the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move for the current player. This method takes as input the current game, the alpha and beta values (used for alpha-beta pruning, a technique for reducing the number of nodes evaluated by the MinMax algorithm), and the current depth of the search tree. If the depth is zero or if there is a winner in the game, the method returns the game rating and no moves. Otherwise, for each possible move, it creates a copy of the game, makes the move, and recursively calls the min_max method on the copy of the game. If the returned rating is greater than alpha, alpha is updated and the move is considered the best move. If beta is less than or equal to alpha, the cycle stops for alpha-beta pruning.
The process is similar for the opponent, with the difference that we try to minimize the rating instead of maximizing it.
- ``choose_action``: Choose the best action (move) for the current player using the Minimax algorithm. The method starts by getting all possible moves for the current player using the `get_possible_moves` function. It then calculates the search depth for the MinMax algorithm based on the number of possible moves. This is done through a for loop that passes through the `levels_Depth` list. If the number of possible moves is greater than a certain value, the depth is set to a certain level. We do this because if we have too many possible moves we will have lower depth otherwise the search would be infinite... For example if we have this [(4,0),(3,23),(2,28),(1,32)], and we have 10 moves we will look at 4 level of depth, but if we have many more possible moves, such as 30, we will look just at the 2 depth. The cycle stops as soon as a level is found that does not exceed the number of possible moves. The method then calls the `min_max` method to determine the best move for the current player. Finally, the method returns the best move.


```python

## Utility functions
---

- ``convert_matrix_to_tuple``: Convert the matrix board representation to a tuple representation.
- ``get_possible_moves``: Returns a list of possible moves for the player. It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the move coordinates and the move direction. Each move is a tuple of the form (row, column, direction). The direction is an enum Move that can be either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'.
- `test_player`: Test the performance of a player against another player. The method takes as input the two players, the number of games to play, and the name of the two players just to specify them in the plot. The method prints the number of wins for the first player and the number of wins for the second player.
- ``plot_total_win_rate``: Creates a bar graph to display the total number of wins of two players in a game. The generated image is saved in the ``images`` folder.
- ``plot_training_trends``: Creates a graph to visualize the trend of total rewards while training a reinforcement learning agent. Within the function, the average of the rewards is calculated every 500 training steps. The generated image is saved in the ``images`` folder.

## Hyperparameters
---
- ``epochs``: training epochs
- ``alpha``: learning rate
- ``discount_factor``: the discount rate of the Bellman equation
- ``min_exploration_rate``: the minimum rate for exploration during the training phase
- ``exploration_decay_rate``: the exploration decay rate used during the training
- ``training_phase``: a boolean value that indicates if the player is in training phase or not. It basically enables the exploration if it is true, otherwise it uses only the `state_value` dictionary to make decisions.
- ``RandomP``: the opponent to play against that use a Random strategy for the RL training
- ``MinMaxP``: the opponent to play against that use a MinMax strategy for the RL testing. It takes as input the `level_depth`, a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the depth level and the maximum number of possible moves for that depth level. For example if there are 5 possible moves, the depth level is 4, if there are 40 possible moves, the depth level is 1.
- ``num_games``: number of games for testing


```python
epochs = 850000
alpha = 0.1
discount_factor = 0.95
min_exploration_rate=0.01
exploration_decay_rate=5e-6
training_phase=True
RandomP = RandomPlayer()
MinMaxP = MinMaxPlayer(0, [(4,0),(3,23),(2,28),(1,32)])
num_games = 1000
```

## Let's do some computation: RL Player trained against Random Player


```python
# create the RL player
rl_agent_RandomOpponent = RLPlayer(
    epochs=epochs,
    alpha=alpha,
    discount_factor=discount_factor,
    min_exploration_rate=min_exploration_rate,
    exploration_decay_rate=exploration_decay_rate,
    opponent=RandomP,
    training_phase=training_phase
)
# train the RL player
rl_agent_RandomOpponent.train(player_name='RL_Player_1')
```

## Test Reinforcement Learning Player vs Random Player
The `RL_player_1` is the best player with this parameters:
- ``epochs`` = 500_000,
- ``alpha`` = 0.1,
- ``discount_factor`` = 0.95,
- ``min_exploration_rate`` = 0.01,
- ``exploration_decay_rate`` = 1e-5,
so you can get it by training with this parameters, and save it with the method `save_policy()`


```python
rl_player = RLPlayer(
    epochs=epochs,
    alpha=alpha,
    discount_factor=discount_factor,
    min_exploration_rate=min_exploration_rate,
    exploration_decay_rate=exploration_decay_rate,
    opponent=RandomP,
    training_phase=False
)

rl_player.load_policy('RL_player_1')
```


```python
test_player(rl_player, RandomP, num_games, 'RL_player_1(first_move)', 'Random Player')
test_player(RandomP, rl_player, num_games, 'Random Player', 'RL_player_1(second_move)')
```

RL Player 1 is the best policy we obtained, and we saved it in ``RL_player_1``. We will use it for the next tests.

## Test MinMax Player vs Random Player


```python
test_player(MinMaxP, RandomP, num_games, 'MinMax Player(first_move)', 'Random Player')
test_player(RandomP, MinMaxP, num_games, 'Random Player', 'MinMax Player(second_move)')
```

## Results and conclusions
---

TODO commentare i risultati e ordinarli un po meglio

We consider a game as a draw if it lasts more than 200 moves (100 moves for player). This is because the game can last forever. In fact, if the two players play optimally, the game will never end.

The main concept, like fitness, mutation and xover are like mine, but we have 2 different
representation of the population. My individual is a set of probability, his is a strategy. His population is composed of strategy, for example 50 strategy. So at the end of the day he selects the best strategy in terms of the one that has more wins.


https://github.com/giacomofantino/computational-intelligence/

This guy uses as fitness the same concept as mine. Instead of number of wins he uses some score, but the main idea is the same. As population he uses the an array of moves. He selects the parent based on the fitness, then he uses mutation and xover like me.

### Received

Hi, this is my review of your lab2 solution.
The work is very good, but I have some ideas that maybe can improve your approach a little:
I think your fitness underestimates your strategy because you always play second, fifty-fifty is better.
reducing the size of the population that will be preserved, in my opinion can accelerate convergence towards the optimal.
For the rest excellent work.


Thanks for the review !
You are right about the fitness function, i'll change it.

Well, seems a good work.
```python
self.p1 = numpy.random.normal(0.5, self.sigma)
```
Canât this be only a simple random() call? So itâll return a number [0;1]? Then you are looping through the n loci that is the number of bits you want to change. But by definition (I think) that the mutation is something like âChange one individual with a certain probabilityâ, but here you are changing n loci individual with the same probability. Is there any xover?

https://github.com/YaldaMobargha/Computational-intelligence

Good job,
```python
points = [randint(0, len(genome1)) for _ in range(num_points)]
```
The only thing I can say is that this random may return the same number, so it may be useful to clear the duplicates. For the rest it seems right

Hi Nicholas!
Your code is clear and easy to follow, and it implements a good solution to the problem.
I have a few suggestions to improve its quality:

While the code is readable, adding more annotations and comments would be beneficial for better understanding of your solution.
The choice of performing a pre-selection before the tournament is interesting but I don't think it leads to good results, as it reduces the diversity of the population. You could instead try using other methods to increase genetic pressure.
I recommend checking, at each iteration, whether the solution is converging so that you can stop the cycle prematurely. This way you can avoid executing loops that do not lead to improvements in the solution, thus reducing execution time.
Your results are clear and readable, however I still suggest the use of graphs to provide a visual comparison of the results at different istances of the problem.

I hope my review was helpful and keep up the good work!

---

The GA is correctly written and do is job, but there are some small tweaks noteworthy:

In the function one_cut_xover, even if not in use, the range of the cut_point should be set to (0, len-1) because if is len you can obtain a xover in which you just invert the two parents genomes
I don't known why in the parent selection, before the tournament, you sort the population and select only the best, when the aim of the tournament selection is to give to everyone the possibility to compete to become parent, in this way you deterministically reduce the population to the best half prior to make the tournamet. In each case if you want to mantain this approach I strongly recommend you to move the sorting outside the parent selection because in this case you re-sort the population for each parent.

As said above in general the GA is well implemented, maybe to increase the performance you can try some of the techniques presented in class regarding the promoting of diversity.

Hi, nice code. In the Q-Learning, as you also wrote, you decided to update the q-table every step instead of every episode. I also saw that you add a reward if the agent is able to block the opponent. Thatâs good. Just one thing, did you try to update the q-table every episode instead of every move to see how that influence the performance?

https://github.com/ArmanBehkish/computational-intelligence 2324

Hi, the code seems to be right. I just donât understand how the reward is computed. Also thereâs no exploration in the move of the RL, maybe you can add a 20% of making a random move and not always the optimal one.

### Received

The work you've done is really good; the code is easy to understand because of the comments. By trying out different methods, it's clear that Q-learning performs better for this kind of application.

A suggestion I can give you to improve the Q-learning performance is to try using a dynamic epsilon parameter that varies during training. This way, you can emphasize exploration more at the beginning and then, in the final part of the training, focus more on exploitation!

Anyway, congratulations on the excellent work!

---

The code is comprehensible and well-structured. Your implementation of Q-learning is encapsulated within the RLPlayer class, specifically in the give_rew function. However, it is crucial to observe that traditional Q-learning involves updating the Q-function based on accumulated experience, which includes the current state, the taken action, and the obtained reward. In your implementation, it appears that the update is influenced solely by the state, rather than considering the complete set of state, action, and reward information associated with the accumulated experience.
You might also want to consider conducting various tests by modifying the parameters of the function to find the optimal values for learning.
